            materials. Designed primarily for undergraduate students with a basic foundation
            in
            quantum physics, this platform combines theoretical insights with hands

            Schwinger equation in both momentum and
            configuration spaces, supported by case studies

            including the hydrogen atom, deuteron,
            and exciton
            -
            all in two dimensions.
            Complementing the theory, our interact
            ive Python Jupyter Notebooks offer practical
            implementations of the Lippmann
            -
            Schwinger equation. Detailed case studies allow you to
            analyze a hydrogen atom using the Coulomb potential, a deuteron using the Malfliet
